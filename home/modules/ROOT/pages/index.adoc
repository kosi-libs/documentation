= Kodein Open Source Initiative documentation

[.lead]
The *Kodein Open Source Initiative* is a suite of libraries that aims to help you to develop Kotlin Multiplatform (mobile) applications.

The *Kodein Open Source Initiative*:

- provides high level tools that enhance your Kotlin/Multiplatform experience
- help you maximize your Kotlin common code, with almost everything but the UI
- and keeps your focus on your business code.


== Libraries

The *Kodein Open Source Initiative* libraries provide:

- the ability to manage your code and isolate your tests easily, with the dependency injection pattern.
- a quick and easy way to persist data model in a performant NoSQL database, for each mobile platforms.

NOTE: Each library can be used independently of each other.


=== xref:kodein::index.adoc[Kodein-DI: Dependency Injection]

_Kodein-DI_ is a very useful dependency injection / retrieval container, it is very easy to use and configure.

._Kodein-DI_ allows you to:
- Lazily instantiate your dependencies when needed.
- Stop caring about dependency initialization order.
- Easily bind classes or interfaces to their instance, provider or factory.
- Easily debug your dependency bindings and recursions.

._Kodein-DI_ is a good choice because:
- It is small, fast and optimized (makes extensive use of `inline`).
- It proposes a very simple and readable declarative DSL.
- It is not subject to type erasure (like Java).
- It integrates nicely with Android.
- It proposes a very kotlin-esque idiomatic API.
- It (also) can be used in plain Java.

._Canard_ is a good choice because:
- It integrates nicely with all Kotlin/Multiplatform targets.
- It has a straightforward design with a user-friendly and comprehensible API.


=== xref:mockmp::index.adoc[MocKMP: Mocking for tests]

_MocKMP_ is a Kotlin Symbol Processor that generates Mocks & Fakes for your test classes.

._MocKMP_ allows you to:
- Generate interface mocks & configure their behaviour.
- Instantiate data classes with fake data.
- Verify calls in order and exhaustively.

._MocKMP_ is a good choice because:
- It mimics, as much as possible, the API of other JVM-only mocking frameworks.
